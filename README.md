## Troubleshooting

| Error/Symptom | Solution |
|--------------|----------|
| "Cannot connect to Exchange Online" | Verify admin permissions |
| "No activities found" | Check date range and filters |
| "The term 'Connect-ExchangeOnline' is not recognized" | Run `Install-Module ExchangeOnlineManagement` |
| Throttling errors | Reduce `-ThrottleLimit` or increase `-IntervalMinutes` |

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Audits**: Schedule weekly/monthly executions
2. **Certificate Auth**: Recommended for automation
3. **Risk Prioritization**: Focus on "High Risk" activities first  
4. **Combine with Alerts**: Trigger workflows for sensitive activities
